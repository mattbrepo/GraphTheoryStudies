Generate a table with graphs and related tables

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2019**

## Why
A table with graphs and related tables (e.g., adjacency matrix) was helpful while studing [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). I wrote a piece of code in Python to generate such a table.
